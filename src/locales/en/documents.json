      "AiTarot Una is an app based on a combination of modern AI technologies and archetypal symbols from the world of Tarot, to provide users with personalized, thoughtful and useful interpretations. The AI does not generate random messages — it analyzes in the context of the user’s question and the card layout.",
      "All spreads in the app (except “Card of the Day” and “Yes/No”, which are intuitive in nature) analyze the cards through a multi-layered symbolic system and try to recognize the internal logic in relation to the user’s query.",
      "How it works: the app offers a list of frequently asked questions, but you can always enter your own question if it’s not among the suggestions — this way you receive an interpretation that is truly personal and relevant.",
      "Access & plans:",
      "• Free: basic access with a limited number of spreads and features.",
      "• Premium: unlocks additional types of spreads and insights.",
      "• Pro: full access to all tools, analysis and personalization.",
      "Besides plans, there is an AdReward option — by watching ads you can unlock certain features as an alternative to paying.",
      "Note: the app does not predict the future in a deterministic sense; it sheds light on potential directions and inner patterns through the archetypal language of cards and symbolism.",
      "App version: 1.0.0"
